**Course:** UCD PHY 104B Computational Methods of Mathematical Physics

**Textbook:** Computational Methods in Physics and Engineering by Samuel S. M. Wong

**Topic:** Particle Confined to a Potential Well

**Goal:** Solve Shroedinger's Equation for a particle in a finite 1-dimensional rectangular potential well where L = 7 fm and u_0 = 10 MeV find all possible energy levels and their corresponding wave functions then compare to the infinite potential well
